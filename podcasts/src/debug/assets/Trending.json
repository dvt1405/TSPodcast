It will help you understand how others have dealt with issues related to protecting the feelings of their adopted families who may be supportive of your search, or question your motives and present challenges.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\n2) For non-adoptees, this podcast will help you understand some of what is in the minds of your friends, family members, or others who are adopted. Perhaps you had questions for them but you didn\u2019t know if you should ask.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe stories will make you smile or bring you to tears, but they\u2019re all true as told by the people who lived them. In them, I hope you\u2019ll find something that inspires you, validates your feelings about wanting to search, or motivates you to have the strength along your journey to learn \u201cWho Am I Really?\u201d",
